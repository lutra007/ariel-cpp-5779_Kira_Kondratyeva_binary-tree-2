The tree:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

Current size is 9

Does tree contains 1? 1
Does tree contains 15? 0

5 is in the root of the tree

The parent of 3 is 5
The parent of 7 is 8

The left offspring of 5 is 3
The right offspring of 6 is 8
The left offspring of 8 is 7

Let's deconstruct the tree from its root:
Step 1
Root to remove is 6
New tree:
1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 
Current size is 8
6 is in a new root of the tree

Step 2
Root to remove is 7
New tree:
1 2 3 4 7 8 9 
Current size is 7
7 is in a new root of the tree

Step 3
Root to remove is 8
New tree:
1 2 3 4 8 9 
Current size is 6
8 is in a new root of the tree

Step 4
Root to remove is 9
New tree:
1 2 3 4 9 
Current size is 5
9 is in a new root of the tree

Step 5
Root to remove is 3
New tree:
1 2 3 4 
Current size is 4
3 is in a new root of the tree

Step 6
Root to remove is 4
New tree:
1 2 4 
Current size is 3
4 is in a new root of the tree

Step 7
Root to remove is 2
New tree:
1 2 
Current size is 2
2 is in a new root of the tree

Step 8
Root to remove is 1
New tree:
1 
Current size is 1
1 is in a new root of the tree
